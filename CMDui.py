"""
This is the View component of the MVC architecture, responsible for handling all the  user-interface-related
functions in the CMD version of the program. It acts as a bridge between the user and the application's core logic,
facilitating user interactions and displaying relevant information from the Model.

This separation of concerns ensures that the user interface logic is decoupled from the business logic, thereby
enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the application.
