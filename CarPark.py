"""
As introduced in System Design Lecture 5, I am following the Model-View-Controller Software Architecture. I have used
the MVC architecture as it optimises partitioning and abstraction while providing a clear separation of concerns.

- Model: Manages data and business logic. In this project, the Model is responsible for the efficient handling of
parking data, leveraging binary search for quick data retrieval and processes such as managing parking spaces.

- View: Handles user interface. The project includes distinct Views for CMD and GUI, tailored to different user
interfaces but sharing the same underlying logic, this means that there is almost zero repeated code.

- Controller: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and View, implementing the core logic for vehicle management
within the program.

This architecture enhances maintainability, as each component can be modified independently. It supports
flexibility and extensibility, allowing easy integration of new features. Robustness is achieved through
decoupled design, isolating changes and failures to individual components. Performance is optimised in each
component via the use of binary search and indexing.

"""
I have implemented a binary search for efficient data retrieval. This method significantly 
reduces the time complexity of search operations from O(n) to O(log n), where n is the number of records in the 
dataset. This will improve performance especially on larger datasets. I have implemented this with scalability in mind.

I have a normal binary search (binary_search) for entry and querying.
I also have adapted binary search (binary_search_latest) for exiting the car park. This is if a car (same registration)
has entered the car park multiple times, when exits, the binary search retrieves the latest entry to avoid errors. 
It is part of the 'Model' in my MVC architecture, but I have separated it here for clarity and single responsibility.
