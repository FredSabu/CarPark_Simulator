Simple Car Park Simulator for System Design and Programming 

Final Grade: 95/100

This repository contains a Car Park Simulator program divided into two parts:

Part 1: Text-Based Simulation
A console-based program that:
Reads initial parking records from a CSV file.
Tracks the number and identifiers of available parking spaces.
Offers menu options to enter or exit the car park, view available spaces, and query parking records by ticket number.
Assigns parking space identifiers and ticket numbers upon entry.
Calculates parking fees upon exit.
Saves updated parking records to a CSV file on exit.

Part 2: GUI-Based Simulation
A TKinter-based GUI program mirroring the functionality of the text-based version, enhancing user interaction.
Implements the same core functionalities with a graphical user interface.

Features:
Interactive menus for navigating the program.
Real-time display of available parking spaces.
Record-keeping of vehicle entry/exit with timestamps.
Fee calculation based on parking duration at a rate of Â£2 per hour.
Parking record lookup via ticket number.

User Input Validation:
The program ensures robust input validation and error handling for a seamless user experience.
Upon closing, the program updates the parking records, preserving data consistency and accuracy for future sessions.
